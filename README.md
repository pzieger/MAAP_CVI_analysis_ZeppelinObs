# This repository collects all functions and scripts needed to reproduce the data and figures in Zieger et al. (2023). Please contact paul.zieger@aces.su.se if you have any questions or remarks.

The Jupyter notebook (eBC in low-level Arctic clouds.ipynb) does main data analysis and creates main figures from the paper (except trajectory calculations)
